# basic-state-machine-3d-character-controller
 The base player I usually build off of on all of my projects.
 You need to use the limboai plugin for this to work. You can install it easily through the godot asset library.
 This is a SUPER basic character controller, its just the bare minimum to get started.
 You can:
 - idle
 - Walk/Run
 - Jump
 
 If you want to use this just download the whole project and move parts you want into your own project, or just build off of this.
 
 I _dont think_ there are any major bugs but knowing me there probably is.
